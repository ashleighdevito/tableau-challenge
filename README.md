The Tableau Story [found here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ashleigh.devito) is described below:

The first two maps in the story illustrate how bikes tend to trickle out from New Jersey over into Manhattan. Both of these Maps are filterable by Month.

The next bar chart identifies the station locations where the number of bikes leaving the station is greater than the bikes arriving.  

The Popular Stations bar chart shows how many rides departed and arrived at each station.  It appears as if the top few stations align in popularity and would be considered busier than other locations.  These may need additional servicing and should be a maintainance priority.

The top starting locations and total location tree additionally show where the bikes are traveling from and arriving to.

Next, the Membership dashboard charts the number of rides taken by members and casual passholders over time.

This is followed by an overview of demand across the entire period from February 2021 to August 2021.  Each chart will allow the user to filter the data.

Finally, a bar chart showing the five most popular stations broken into the days of the week for each ride.


Primary Insights:

As Summer approached, the South Waterfront Walkway became extrememly popular, especially for weekend rides.  This may have been because it was not available until May, and is now servicing an area that was not as accessible over the winter. It's location near the waterfront parks, piers, and food establishments have been developed for pedestrian use and would make this station ideal for day trips along the river.

Additionaly, as summer approached, the rider demographics changed from primarily members riding to casual passholders overtaking members in the number of rides.  Both categories increased significantly as the weather warmed.

There are very clearly peak "hours" around 6pm daily, where the most rides depart from stations.

Certain stations are used more for 'commuters' during the work week, like the Grove Street PATH.  Others service more recreational use over the weekends, suce as the South Waterfront Walkway and the Newport Parkway.
